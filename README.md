# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Revisited
Revisited version of the console-based Rock Paper Scissors project built using JavaScript. This project will include HTML + CSS so that the game can be played in the webpage.

Rules: The game should be played entirely through the UI by clicking on buttons. Display a running score and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.
